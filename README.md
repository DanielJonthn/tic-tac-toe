# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe - Classic & Enhanced Version

Welcome to the **Tic Tac Toe** project! This game is built with **React** and features two exciting game modes:

✅ **Classic Tic Tac Toe** – The traditional 3x3 game with Player vs Player mode.  
🔥 **Tic Tac Toe 2 (Enhanced Version)** – A new twist! Each player can only have 2 marks on the board at a time. Placing a third mark removes the earliest placed mark if it's not a winning move, making the game unpredictable and strategic.
